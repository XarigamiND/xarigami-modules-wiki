Text Formatting Rules
=====================

This wiki uses the same syntax, in the main, as the original phpWiki (http://http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?TextFormattingRules)

Paragraphs
- Text will wrap automatically at the window width edge as needed.
- If you need to generate a line break use three percent signs (%) (like <br>).

Headings
- use exclamation marks at start and beginning of a heading
- one or more ! up to six gives headings h6 to h1
- you can also use two or more = in a row up to seven for the same h6 to h1
- text bound by 3 dashes (---) will be centred

Horizontal Lines
- Four or more minus signs (----) at the beginning of a line make a horizontal rule.
- three %%% makes a line break

Lists
- Begin a line with * to create an unordered list item.
- Use ** for the second level, etc.
- Use  # for numbered lists


Text formatting
- ~~monospace text~~
- ~~~code block~~~
- ++strikethrough++ text
- __underlined text__
- Use two single-quotes ('') for emphasis (usually italics)
- Use tripled underscore (___) or three single-quotes (''') for strong or bold
- use five underscore (_____) or five single quotes('''''), for bold emphasis (usually bold italics)


Indented paragraphs (quotes)
- indent with one or two spaces at beginning of the line

Definitions
- four spaces followed by Definition Name: followed by four spaces and definition will produce a definition list

Links
- Add URLS with allowed protocols such as ftp, gopher, mailto or news and they will create a link automatically
eg
http://c2.com/
mailto:swain@wcsb.org
http://www.redhat.com/

Mark-Up Language
In theory, it is possible to mix, in the same text, wiki encoding and html ...


Links:
- A [link|http://www.domain.com] will work, in a different window.
- A [link|www.domain.com] will work, in same window.
- A [link|SomeDir] will work, calling the content page SomePage in the same domain.

Images:
- An image can be [text for alt text|http://www.domain.com/picturefolder/nameofimage.png] included with a link and an alt text.
- An image can be [text for alt text|http://www.domain.com/|picture:folder/nameofimage.png] included with a link and an alt text. [NOT WORKING]
   The clause "picture:folder/nameofimage.png" is evident: folder is where is the image shown, folder being relative to the root.

Attention, the html tag <img> has to be allowed in your settings, including parameters.
